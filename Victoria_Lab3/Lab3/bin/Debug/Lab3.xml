 In this lab we have to create an application that takes in the input for 7 days, and calculate the average of all 7 inputs.
 After this has been completed, we have to do this process 2 more times using 2d arrays to get the averages of 2 more employees.
 The last step will be to calculate the average of all three employee's averages.
